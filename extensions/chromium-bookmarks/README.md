# Chromium bookmarks

An extension to browse bookmarks saved by chromium-based web browsers.

Browsers are automatically detected by scanning the user config directory.

Due to the fact chromium-based browsers and firefox browsers store their bookmarks in completely different ways, this extension is specifically targeting chromium bases.
